# Test-1


1. The code begins by importing the necessary modules and classes. It imports unittest for the testing framework and patch from unittest.mock for creating test stubs.
2. The Solution class is defined, which contains the largestRectangleArea method. This method takes a list of heights as input and calculates the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed using the heights.
3. The SolutionTests class is defined, which is a subclass of unittest.TestCase. It contains the unit tests for the largestRectangleArea method.
4. In the setUp method of the SolutionTests class, an instance of the Solution class is created. This allows me to call the largestRectangleArea method inside the test methods.
5. The first test method, test_largestRectangleArea, contains multiple test cases. Each test case represents a specific scenario with different input heights. For each test case, the largestRectangleArea method is called with the input heights, and the obtained result is compared using self.assertEqual to check if it matches the expected result.
6. The second test method, test_largestRectangleArea_with_mocked_print, demonstrates the use of a test stub. The print function is mocked using the @patch('builtins.print') decorator. Within this test method, the largestRectangleArea method is called with specific heights, and the expected result is compared. Additionally, mock_print.assert_called_once_with is used to verify that the print function is called correctly during the execution of the largestRectangleArea method.
7. The third test method, test_largestRectangleArea_slow_test_case, is skipped using the @unittest.skip decorator. This test case is marked as slow because it involves large input heights, which may take a significant amount of time to calculate. By skipping this test case, it allows for faster execution of the test suite during regular testing.
8. The fourth test method, test_largestRectangleArea_failing_test_case, is marked with @unittest.expectedFailure decorator. This test case intentionally fails to demonstrate a failing scenario. It uses input heights in descending order, which exposes a bug in the current implementation. By marking it as an expected failure, it helps in identifying and reporting the bug to the development team.
9. The final if __name__ == '__main__': block runs the test suite by calling unittest.main(). This runs all the test methods defined within the SolutionTests class.
When you run the code, the testing framework executes the test methods one by one. It reports the results, indicating whether each test case passed or failed. Additionally, if a test method is skipped or marked as an expected failure, it provides information about those scenarios as well.
By incorporating the use of test stubs, intentional failing test cases, and other test annotations, the code aims to improve the effectiveness of testing, bug detection, and reporting, ultimately enhancing the quality and reliability of the largestRectangleArea method.



1. Finding and Reporting Bugs:
    * This test case uses heights in descending order, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation. By adding this failing test case, it helps to uncover the bug and report it to the development team for fixing.

2. Test Parametrization:
    * I can achieve similar functionality using external libraries such as parameterized or pytest. However, in this example, I have not used test parametrization to keep the code compatible with the standard unittest module.
